# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style
The dashboard's textual content (labels, descriptions, tooltips) should adopt an **Engaging and Action-Oriented** prose style. This means using active voice, encouraging user interaction, and facilitating decision-making.

## Brand Messaging
The tone for communicating with users should be **Professional and Formal**. This emphasizes authority, precision, and adherence to strict guidelines, suitable for a data visualization and project management context.

## Visual Identity
The visual identity of the dashboard will be characterized by a **Clean and Minimalist Layout**, focusing on essential information with ample white space to enhance readability. It will also utilize a **Dark Theme with High Contrast** to create a "Control Room" aesthetic, improving visibility and reducing eye strain during prolonged use.

## Data Presentation
Data will be presented to ensure maximum clarity and user understanding through:
*   **Interactive Charts and Graphs:** Allowing users to drill down into data and filter views for detailed analysis.
*   **Color-coding for Status:** A consistent color palette will be used to indicate different statuses (e.g., green for complete, red for blocked) for quick comprehension.
*   **Clear Labels and Tooltips:** Comprehensive context and explanations will be provided for all data points and UI elements to improve usability.

## General Content Guidelines
Any additional text or documentation within the dashboard should:
*   **Focus on Actionability:** Content should guide users to insights and encourage next steps.
*   **Maintain Consistency:** A uniform style, terminology, and formatting should be used across all documentation.
