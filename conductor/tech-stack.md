# Technology Stack

## Frontend
The frontend of the Progress Visualization Dashboard will be built using:
*   **React with TypeScript:** For building a robust and scalable user interface.
*   **Vite:** As the build tool for a fast development experience.
*   **Recharts:** For creating interactive charts and graphs to visualize progress.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For a utility-first CSS framework to rapidly build custom designs.

## Backend
The backend of the Progress Visualization Dashboard will be powered by:
*   **Node.js with Express.js:** A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for building APIs.
*   **TypeScript:** To provide type safety and enhance code quality for the backend services.

## Data Storage and Management
*   There will be **no traditional database** for this project. Instead, **Git repository Conductor artifacts will act as the primary data source**. The backend will be responsible for fetching, parsing, and processing these artifacts to generate the data required for the dashboard.
